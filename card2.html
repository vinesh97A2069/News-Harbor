                            “My children, along with their father, have a common belief that dynastic wealth, though both legal and common in much of the world including the United States, is not desirable," the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. chief executive officer said in a Thanksgiving letter to shareholders.
                            
                            Warren Buffett, ranked as the world's ninth-richest individual with a net worth of $120.8 billion, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has seen his fortune grow by $13.3 billion this year.
                            
                            
                            This act follows Buffett's annual summer donations to these foundations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. For the second consecutive year, Buffett has extended additional gifts to the family foundations during the Thanksgiving period.
                            
                            Buffett shared plans for his children to serve as trustees of a charitable trust inheriting 99 per cent of his wealth after his passing. He said that the charitable donation of his wealth will be transparent and open to public scrutiny.
                            
                            The 93-year-old billionaire, who expressed feeling “good but fully realise I am playing in extra innings,” emphasised his commitment to simplicity, saying that the disposition of his assets will be outlined in a straightforward will available for inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse in Omaha, Nebraska, where he resides.
