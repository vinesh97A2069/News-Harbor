       <h1>President Murmu backs all-India test to appoint judges</h1>
       <p>The President emphasised that a more varied representation of India’s unique diversity on the bench and the bar helps serve the cause of justice better.</p>
        <p>President Droupadi Murmu on Sunday favoured the creation of an All-India Judicial Service (AIJS) to pick judges from varied backgrounds through a process, which she said, should be merit-based, competitive and transparent</p>
        <p>Speaking at the Constitution Day celebrations, Murmu emphasised that a more varied representation of India’s unique diversity on the bench and the bar definitely helps serve the cause of justice better, adding one way to hasten the diversification process can be the creation of a system in which judges can be recruited from different backgrounds through a merit-based and transparent process.

            “There can be an All-India Judicial Service which can select brilliant youngsters and nurture and promote their talents from lower levels to higher levels. Those who aspire to serve the bench can be <br>selected from across the country to create a larger pool of talent. Such a system can offer opportunities to the less represented social groups too,” she said.</p>
       <h1>Investor's social media post on India gets PM Modi's attention: 'Love your optimism'</h1>
            <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday lauded Indian-American entrepreneur and investor Balaji S Srinivasan for his optimism about the investment environment in India. Investing in India is improving India, Balaji wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, adding that he likes to invest in India and Indians because there is growth potential in Bharat. The investor made a long post supporting his argument, which got a nod from the PM who shared Balaji's post and wrote: "I love your optimism and will add -- the people of India are trendsetters and trailblazers when it comes to innovation. We welcome the world to invest in our nation. India won't disappoint."

       <h1>Parliament supremacy not amenable to intervention from Executive, Judiciary: VP Dhankhar</h1>
                <p>Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday strongly emphasised Parliament's sovereignty in his Constitution Day address, asserting that any encroachment into its exclusive domain would be a constitutional aberration, contradicting the democratic essence and values.</p>
                <p>“Sovereignty of Parliament synonymous with the sovereignty of the nation and it's impregnable,” VP Dhankhar said at the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Ministry of Law and Justice at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi.</p>
                <p>"There is a dividing line between what the legislature can do, and what the legislature can't do when there is a judgment of the court. If a judgment decides a particular issue and it points out a deficiency in law, it is always open for the legislature to enact a fresh law to cure the deficiency," the CJI said.

                    "What the legislature cannot do is to say that we think the judgment is wrong and therefore we overrule the judgment. The judgment of a court cannot be directly overruled by the legislature," the CJI said.
                    
                    He also said judges are guided by constitutional morality and not public morality while adjudicating cases.
                    
                    ‘Ambedkar declined to draft Article 370’
                    The vice president also said that Article 370, the law which dealt with temporary provisions with respect to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, was not drafted by the drafting committee. All other articles were drafted, and Dr Ambedkar declined to draft it, the VP said.</p>
